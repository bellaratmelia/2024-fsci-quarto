    "text": "About This Course\nIn academic research, the journey from raw data to published findings often lacks transparency, posing significant challenges to reproducibility and trust in scientific research. This situation highlights the need for enhanced transparency and traceability within research methodologies.\nThe primary objective of this course is to equip participants with the necessary skills to use Quarto and RStudio to publish research in a transparent and reproducible way. These tools enable an integrated research workflow encompassing data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and publishing, producing verifiable research outputs and artifacts. They facilitate validation and replication of research findings, thereby enhancing the integrity and credibility of published work.\nQuarto, an open-source scientific publishing system, allows researchers to weave together narrative text, code, mathematical formulas (using LATeX), and even citations to produce elegantly formatted output as documents, web pages, blog posts, books and other formats to cater to diverse publishing needs. While Quarto is also compatible with Python and Julia, the course will predominantly focus on its application in R programming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPrior experience with R is highly recommended for this course."
