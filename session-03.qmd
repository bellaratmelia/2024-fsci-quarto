# Quarto Websites

## Why do I need a website?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**For yourself:**

-   Highlight your work, including research papers, grants, publications, and ongoing projects, to make your contributions easily accessible to the academic community and the public.

-   Share teaching materials, lecture notes, and other educational resources with students and colleagues.

**For your research group / lab:**

-   Highlight research projects, publications, findings, and achievements to a broader audience including potential collaborators, funding agencies, and the general public.

-   Provide updates and news about ongoing research, funding opportunities, and events.

-   Attract prospective students, postdocs, and researchers who are interested in joining the lab by providing information on available positions, application procedures, and the benefits of working with the lab.

## Why not use Sharepoint / WordPress / SquareSpace / etc?

Couple of reasons: [^1]

[^1]: <https://slides.yihui.org/2017-rmarkdown-UNL-Yihui-Xie.html#36>

-   No R Markdown support (even math support is often nonexistent or awkward)

-   Huge benefits of static websites compared to dynamic websites

    -   all static files, no PHP or databases, no login/password, work everywhere (even offline)

    -   typically fast to visit (no computation needed on the server side), and easy to speed up via CDN

-   Other options cost money (especially SquareSpace and Wordpress.com) (+ they may do things on your content)

## Quarto Website vs Quarto Document

-   Quarto website is a form **Quarto Project** with multiple quarto documents inside.

    -   Being in a Quarto Project indicates that these documents are connected / related to each other

    -   Essentially the same concept as **R Project**

-   Each of this document act as a webpage â€“ the default format will be `format: html`

-   Having said that, you can also have a presentation as part of the website (just like this course website!)

## Anatomy of a Quarto Website

In a new Quarto Website project, you will see the following files:

|                      |                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `_quarto.yml`        | The Quarto website project file. You can define site-wide YAML headers here, including the website navigation |
| `about.qmd`          | The about page - automatically created                                                                        |
| `index.qmd`          | The website home page - automatically created                                                                 |
| `styles.css`         | Additional CSS styling if you'd like to customize further                                                     |
| `project_name.Rproj` | The R project file                                                                                            |
