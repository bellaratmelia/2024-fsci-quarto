## Overview for today

-   Quarto website (+ publishing to Quarto Pub and GitHub Pages)

-   Advanced Quarto format for future explorations: Quarto Manuscripts and Quarto Books

# Quarto Websites

## Why do I need a website?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**For yourself:**

-   Highlight your work, including research papers, grants, publications, and ongoing projects,

-   Make your contributions easily accessible to the academic community and the public.

-   Share teaching materials, lecture notes, and other educational resources with students and colleagues.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**For your research group / lab:**

-   Highlight research projects, publications, findings, and achievements to a broader audience (including potential collaborators, funding agencies, and the general public.)

-   Provide updates and news about ongoing research, funding opportunities, and events.

-   Attract prospective students, postdocs, and researchers who are interested in joining the lab.

## Why not use Sharepoint / WordPress / SquareSpace / etc?

Couple of reasons: [^1]

[^1]: <https://slides.yihui.org/2017-rmarkdown-UNL-Yihui-Xie.html#36>

-   No R Markdown support (even math support is often nonexistent or awkward)

-   Huge benefits of static websites compared to dynamic websites

    -   all static files, no PHP or databases, no login/password, work everywhere (even offline)

    -   typically fast to visit (no computation needed on the server side), and easy to speed up via CDN

-   Other options cost money (especially SquareSpace and Wordpress.com) (+ they may do things on your content)

## Quarto Website vs Quarto Document

-   Quarto website is a form **Quarto Project** with multiple quarto documents inside.

-   **Quarto Project** indicates that these documents are connected / related to each other.

-   In Quarto website, each quarto document act as a webpage – the default format will be `format: html`

-   Having said that, you can also have a presentation as part of the website (just like this course website!)

## Anatomy of a Quarto Website

In a new Quarto Website project, you will see the following files:

+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `_quarto.yml`        | The Quarto website project file. You can define site-wide YAML headers here, including the website navigation. |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `about.qmd`          | The about page - automatically created                                                                         |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `index.qmd`          | The website home page - automatically created                                                                  |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `styles.css`         | Additional CSS styling if you'd like to customize further                                                      |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| `project_name.Rproj` | The R project file                                                                                             |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

To add new pages or presentations to your website, simply add a new `.qmd` file and adjust the navigation in `_quarto.yml` file.

## Publishing options

There are several options, each with its own advantages [^2]

[^2]: <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/>

+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Quarto Pub    | Publishing service for Quarto documents, websites, and books. Use Quarto Pub when you want a free, easy to use service for publicly available content. Note: does not support private sites and there is no option to add collaborators or version control. |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GitHub Pages  | Publish content based on source code managed within a GitHub repository. Use GitHub Pages when the source code for your document or site is hosted on GitHub. Since it's on GitHub, you can add collaborators and apply version control.                    |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Netlify       | Professional web publishing platform. Use Netlify when you want support for custom domains, authentication, previewing branches, and other more advanced capabilities.                                                                                      |
+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Posit Connect | Publishing platform for secure sharing of data products within an organization. Use Posit Connect when you want to publish content within an organization rather than on the public internet.                                                               |

# Let's try it together!

Refer to `04-websites/publishing-to-quartopub.qmd` for the step-by-step guide for this activity.

## Publishing to GitHub - Refresher on Git

[**Some glossaries:**]{.underline}

-   **Git**: Git is a popular version control system that helps you manage and keep track of your source code history. It's widely used in software development but can be used for any set of files you want to track changes to.

-   **GitHub**: GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and is widely used for software development and collaborative projects. It provides a place to host your Git repositories and offers additional features to enhance collaboration, project management, and code sharing.

-   **Repositories (Repos)**: A Git repository is where your project’s files and their history are stored. You can create a new repo or clone (copy) an existing one.

-   **Remote Repos**: These are hosted versions of your local repo on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. You can push your changes to a remote repo to share with others or to back up your work. Others can clone your remote repo and contribute to it.

-   **Commits**: A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a certain point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and includes a message describing what changes were made. You can commit changes locally and push them to a remote repository.

## Refresher on Git (continued)

-   **Branches**: A branch is a separate line of development. The default branch is usually called "main" or "master". You can create new branches to work on features or fixes without affecting the main branch.

-   **Merging**: Merging is the process of combining changes from different branches. When your feature or fix is ready, you merge it back into the main branch.

-   **Pushing**: uploading your local repository content to a remote repository.

-   **Pulling**: fetching and combining changes from a remote repository to your local repository.

## Refresher on Git - Typical Git Workflow (with analogy)

<style type="text/css">
    .table75 td:nth-child(1) {width: 10%;}  
    .table75 td:nth-child(2) {width: 55%;}
    .table75 td:nth-child(3) {width: 35%;}

## Publishing to GitHub

There are 3 ways to publish to GitHub[^3]:

[^3]: <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html>

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
**Option 1: Manual transfer**

1.  Render quarto website on your local machine

2.  Manually transfer the rendering result (placed in `_site` folder to your GitHub repository's `gh-pages` branch. GitHub Pages will use the contents inside this branch.
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
**Option 2: Publishing command**

1.  Render quarto website on your local machine.

2.  Use `quarto publish gh-pages` command in your terminal to publish the rendering results to GitHub.
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**Option 3: GitHub Action**

-   Instead of rendering in local machine, set up a GitHub action file to instruct GitHub to render the website on the "cloud".

1.  Push source code change to GitHub repository.

2.  GitHub renders the contents on the "cloud" and then display the result via GitHub Pages.

3.  (optional) You can also instruct GitHub to execute any code chunks on the "cloud" by modifying the GitHub action file to ensure the correct package versions are installed.

For today, let's try **option #3**! Refer to `04-websites/publishing-to-gh-pages.qmd` for the step-by-step guide for this activity.

# Advanced Quarto Format: Blogs, Books and Manuscripts

## Quarto Blog

Exactly like Quarto website, but with added blog functionality! Some examples:
