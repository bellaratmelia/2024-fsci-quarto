Load the `tidyverse` library\n2.  Visualize the distribution of color and kind of cuts for each color\n\n## Anatomy of a code chunk\n\nFor R, the code chunks are generated with the help of `knitr` package.\n\nEach code chunk will have a list of **cell options** that looks like this if you use `source` view:\n\n```{{r}}\n#| label: fig-polar\n#| echo: false\n#| output: true\n```\n\nThere are many code chunk options, but the important ones are:\n\n-   `echo` - Whether to display the source code in the rendered output (true/false)\n\n-   `output` - Whether to display the output of the code (true/false)\n\n-   `label` - Unique label for the code chunks - useful for cross-referencing!\n\n-   `output-location` - Location of output relative to the code that generates it (more relevant for presentations)\n\n## Code Highlights\n\n## Code Annotations\n\n-   Code blocks and executable code cells in Quarto can include line-based annotations to further explain the code and the flow of the logic to your readers.\n\n-   Pretty much like footnotes, but for your code chunks.\n\n-   Great for teaching / presentation!\n\n## Anatomy of a code annotation\n\n````         \n```r\n#| echo: true\n#| output-location: fragment\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)                                  #<1>\n\ndiamonds %>% ggplot(aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +   #<2>\n    geom_bar()                                      #<2>\n```\n1.  load the tidyverse library for the ggplot package\n2.  Visualize the distribution of color and kind of cut for each color\n````\n\n-   Each annotated line must end with a comment using the language-specific comment character for the code cell, followed by a space and the annotation number enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `# <1>`).\n\n-   If the annotation covers multiple lines, the same annotation number can be repeated.\n\n-   After the code cell, provide an ordered list that details the contents of each annotation. Each item in this list should correspond to the line(s) of code marked with the same annotation number.\n\n# Let's try this together!\n\nHands-on exercises to explore the cell options and code annotations!\n\n# Citations and Footnotes\n\n## Citations in Quarto\n\nBy default, Quarto will use Pandoc engine to convert the in-text citations and generate the references in your document. You will need the following components:\n\n1.  A **quarto document** formatted with in-text citations in Rmarkdown syntax (more on this later).\n\n2.  A **bibliographic file**, e.g. BibLaTeX (.bib) or BibTeX (.bibtex) file.\n\n3.  A **Citation Style Language (CSL) file** which specifies the formatting to use when generating the citations and bibliography (when not using natbib or biblatex to generate the bibliography).\n\n    -   By default, Quarto will use the Chicago style. You can download additional .csl file in this CSL Project repository: <https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles>\n\n## Bibliographic data source + CSL file\n\nBoth files have to be specified in the YAML header like so: (In this example, the `.bib` file and the `.csl` file is located in the same folder as the `.qmd` document.)\n\n```         \n---\ntitle: \"Manuscript\"\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: nature.csl\n---\n```\n\n-   `references.bib` is the bibliographic text file. This will also be automatically generated after you include a citation in your document for the first time.\n\n-   `nature.csl` is the citation style document, in this example is the nature citation style. You will need to download the csl file from the repository and place it in your working directory. CSL Project repository: <https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles>\n\n## In-text citations\n\nCommon ones:\n\n| Syntax                                                                              | Output                                                                            |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| `@katz2021` mentioned that...                                                       | @katz2021 mentioned that...                                                       |\n| Katz et al. `[-@katz2021]` mentioned that...                                        | Katz et al. [-@katz2021] mentioned that...                                        |\n| Software citation is good `[@katz2021, pp. 33-35]`                                  | Software citation is good [@katz2021, pp. 33-35]!                                 |\n| More researchers are saying that software citation is good `[@katz2021; @park2019]` | More researchers are saying that software citation is good [@katz2021; @park2019] |\n\n## The References section\n\nBy default, Quarto will place the references section at the end of the document. You can also specify the placement by putting this section in your document (note that the example below is the `source` view on Quarto):\n\n```         \n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n```\n\n## References section output\n\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n# Let's try this together!\n\nLet's explore citations, footnotes, and cross-referencing in Quarto!\n\n# Specific features for Scholarly Writing\n\n## Academic Templates with Quarto Journals\n\n-   Quarto provides extensions for manuscript writing that contains styles specific for several journals/publishers, such as PLOS, ACM, JOSS, Elsevier, and more.\n\n-   See here for more info: <https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-journals.html> - some of the templates are contributed by the member of community.\n\n-   These extensions provide rich YAML metadata specifically for academic writing.\n\n-   Let's dive into these metadata first before we explore the templates!\n\n## Front Matter\n\nScholarly articles demand extensive details in their front matter, beyond just a title and author. Quarto offers a comprehensive range of YAML metadata keys to include these details. This metadata covers specifying authors and their affiliations, abstract, keywords, copyright, licensing, and funding.\n\nBelow is a YAML header example:\n\n```         \n---\ntitle: \"Library Carpentry: Best practices in organizing shelf space in the library\"\ndate: 2024-07-01\nauthor:\n  - name: Bella Ratmelia\n    id: br\n    orcid: 0000-0003-4913-9508\n    email: bellar@smu.edu.sg\n    corresponding: true\n    affiliation: \n      - name: Singapore Management University\n        city: Singapore\n        url: www.smu.edu.sg\n  - name: Danping Dong\n    id: dp\n    orcid: 0000-0003-4913-9508\n    email: bellar@smu.edu.sg\n    affiliation: \n      - name: Singapore Management University\n        city: Singapore\n        url: www.smu.edu.sg\nabstract: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

We can change it to render to Word by changing the YAML header like so:\n\n```         \n---\ntitle: \"Library Carpentry: Best practices in organizing shelf space in the library\"\nformat:\n  docx:\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\n    highlight-style: github\n---\n```\n\n::: callout-note\n**You need to have Microsoft Word installed to be able to produce and view the Word output.**\n:::\n\n## Rendering to PDF\n\nSimilar to docx, you can change the render output to PDF by amending the YAML header like so:\n\n```         \n---\ntitle: \"Library Carpentry: Best practices in organizing shelf space in the library\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    toc: true\n    number-sections: true\n    colorlinks: true\n    highlight-style: github\n---\n```\n\n::: callout-note\nLatest version of Quarto has a built-in built in PDF compilation engine, which among other things performs automatic installation of `TinyTex` and any missing TeX packages (required for LaTeX rendering)\n\nIf you encounter persistent errors when rendering to PDF, a workaround that I like to use is to render it to an HTML page, and then \"print\" them as PDF.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nYou can update or install TinyTex in the RStudio Terminal with this command:\n\n`quarto install tinytex`\n:::\n\n# Let's try this together!\n\nAmend the YAML header in your document to convert it to PDF/ Word. Does the output look different than what you expected?\n\n# Presentation with RevealJS\n\n## Why RevealJS (and not ppt?)\n\n-   Not a proprietary format - it is rendered as HTML slides which you can put on GitHub if you'd like to host it online.\n\n-   Can be downloaded as PDF for easier distribution\n\n-   Text-based using Rmarkdown - easier to edit and incorporate codes, code output, callouts, etc.\n\n## Rendering to Presentation\n\nSimilar to docx and PDF, we can change the render output format to revealjs through the YAML header like so:\n\n```         \n---\ntitle: \"Habits\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\nformat: revealjs\n---\n```\n\n::: callout-note\n**Fun Fact: The slides for this workshops are created with Quarto and RevealJS!**\n:::\n\n## Header options for RevealJS presentations\n\nThere are many options, but several ones that you may find useful:\n\n-   `incremental` - controls whether to show all bullet points at once, or as you progress the slides.\n\n-   `slide-number` - controls whether to show slide numbers (will appear at the bottom right corner)\n\n-   `theme` - Theme name, theme scss file, or a mix of both.\n\n-   `scrollable` - controls whether to allow content that overflows slides vertically to scroll. This can also be set per-slide by including the `.scrollable` class on the slide title.\n\n# Let's try it together!\n\nHands-on exercises to create and modify RevealJS presentation.\n",
