## Recap from yesterday

We covered the following topic:

-   Quarto and Research Transparency and Reproducibility

-   Rmarkdown basics

## Overview for today

-   Literate Programming - Weaving Code chunks with narrative text (using `knitr` )

-   Citations and Footnotes

-   Academic templates

-   Rendering to static Word document and RevealJS presentation (like this presentation!)

## Refresher: Literate Programming

> Literate Programming, introduced by Donald Knuth in the 1980s, is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the intertwining of human-readable documentation and source code.

Essentially:

-   The program is written as a coherent narrative where code segments and explanations are woven together in a way that emphasizes understanding and readability

-   The code segments ordered in a logical manner for the reader, rather than the order required by the compiler.

-   The narrative format helps to bridge the gap between the code and the theoretical framework, ensuring that the computational steps are aligned with the objectives.

In Quarto, this is enabled through **Code Chunks**

## Introducing: Code Chunks

An example of code chunk:

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)                              # <1>

diamonds %>% ggplot(aes(x = color, fill = cut)) + # <2>
    geom_bar()
```

1.  Load the `tidyverse` library
2.  Visualize the distribution of color and kind of cuts for each color

## Citations

RStudio will detect Zotero installation and access your Zotero library

Once you cite, Quarto will create a bib file

The style is determined by the `.csl` file. You can download it from the CSL repo

There are various ways to do in-text citations

## Footnotes

This is how you can add footnotes

Exercise: Look at a sample document, let's try to recreate this.

Alternatively, if you have a working paper with Footnores, you can try to recreate yours in Quarto!

## Academic Templates with Quarto Journals

# Rendering to Docx or PDF

## Rendering to Docx

Simplest way is to change the YAML

Of course you have to have MS word installed.

## Rendering to PDF

workaround: if you can't render it to PDF, a workaround that I like to use is to render it to HTML page, and the "print" them as PDF

# Rendering to Presentation
